	4. Client clarifications

	Question: 

Dear client, 

The User Story 3001 points to the US 3.3.1 -> "Create a new survey. A survey is characterized by an alphanumeric code, a description, the period( in days) it will be performed, the intended questionnaire, and a set of rules that allows the system to determine the survey target audience."

However, what are the limitations of the survey's alphanumeric characters and explanation?

	Answer:

So because of the fundamental limitations the code has to contain an alphanumeric value with 15 characters max and the description has to be non-empty short sentence.

	Question:
	
Dear client,

According to my understanding, the questionnaire must be constructed using our application's command-line interface and then transferred so the grammar will be evaluated.

Is my understanding correct?

Could we convert it to XML, for example, and then check its grammar?

Thanks.

	Answer:

Data import/export is not required.
All elements should be blended.
I recommend that you consult with technical professionals
