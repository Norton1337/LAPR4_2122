## US3000 - Specify new grammar
=======================================

# 1. Requirements

## 1.1 Interpretation of Requirements

- As Project Manager, I want the team to specify a grammar allowing to express several kinds of questionnaires.
- 
- The grammar should be conceived having in mind its reusability/applicability on other application domains than the one of this project (e.g., pedagogical questionnaires).

- The development team is requested to conceive/design/implement a generic base solution
that can be easily reused on other systems/domains

- No template will be provided, teams are free to adopt the format foreseen as best suitable
for the project purposes
